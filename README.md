## Homemade

### What is homemade
Homemade is a network for people like you and me to eat awesome homemade meals made by locals. There are so many people in your neighboorhood that make some of the best food you'll ever eat. Stop eating subways and take away chinese buffets and eat from people who are actually from that culture. 

My grandmother comes from Italy and she makes food that'll make you want to sit down. You probably want food like this too. This is what homemade does.
